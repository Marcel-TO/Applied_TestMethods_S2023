## Prepairing the Project in VS Code

### **Prerequisites**
- Visual Studio Code with the python extension
- some important packages

In Python it is common to import external libraries to call important functions. These libraries must be installed before they can be used. By installing Python it is now possible to execute the `pip3 install NAMEOFPACKAGE` or `py -m pip install NAMEOFPACKAGE` command in a terminal to install the needed libraries.

### **Installed Libraries**
- `pip install beautifulsoup4`
- `pip install selenium`
